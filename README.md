On this project, I predicted Supply Chain out-stocking by performing Gradient Boosting, Neural Network, SVM, Logistics, Models on grid search 
to perform binary classification using inventory data, used sampling techniques to deal with the class imbalance problem.
The best model achieved 98% AUC on ROC curve.
